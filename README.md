# Using-Keras-to-Build-and-Train-Recurrent-Neural-Networks

In this task, I will be developing a LSTM network using the Keras to solve a time-series 
prediction problem.

As the name suggests, time-series is a collection of data points collected at constant 
time intervals. These are analysed to determine the long term trend so as to forecast 
the future or perform some other form of analysis. 

The problem we are going to look at in this task is the International Airline Passengers 
prediction problem. For this problem we are given a year and a month we need to predict 
the number of international airline passengers in units of 1,000. In other words we need 
to answer the question, "Given the number of passengers (in units of thousands) this month, 
what is the number of passengers next month?". 

The data ranges from January 1949 to December 1960 with 144 observations.
